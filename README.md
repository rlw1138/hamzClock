Simple clock displays UTC and Local Time on android phone

This is an just html page that uses JavaScript to display the UTC time along with Local Time and date.

That's it.

It scales sorta-kinda, so you can put it on a tablet (untested) or laptop or turn the phone over to landscape if you need larger numbers.

There's an APK to install on an android, and I pulled the HTML out if you want to just copy to a folder and look at it in a browser.

I run it on a Pixel 3A, rooted, with LineageOS, using APPC for charging management so I can keep it on a charging stand 24/7 without it blowing up.

I also use a very cool app called KinScreen (appstore) to keep the screen on for extended periods while I'm messing with the radios. Recommended!
